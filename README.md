# SIR-model-simulation
This is a very basic implementation of the [SIR model for virus spreading][1].
It lets you visualize how the three differential equations evolve over time, by
printing a table to the terminal.
This is the first part of my coding exam final project at University of Bologna,
year one physics course.
